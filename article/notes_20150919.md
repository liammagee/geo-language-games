# General Notes

* Language as Space
    - Patches representing linguistic territory
    - Networks
* Language Change as 
    - Generational 
    - Interactional
    - Combination
* Model:
    - Agent language: graph outputs
    - Geosocial affiliation: patch colour / agent colour
    - Centre point of colour: homing coordinates
    - Landscape has a language: strong or weak associations
        + Formalism vs emergent grammar
    - Networks as social ties
    - Movement algorithms
        + Random
        + A* path finding
        + Desire paths
    - Interactions
* Ontology of theories 
    - metamodel and measurement of distance
    - commensurability
    - macro vs micro
    - generational transmission
    - frequency effects (mechanistic)
    - creolisation
        + language mixing: creolisation vs language hybridisation
    - Principle of parsimony in modelling multiple theories
        + Changing value of a parameter
        + Different parameter
        + Different functional treatment of parameters
* Theoretical positions: 
    - Emergent grammar
    - Grammatalisation
    - Agent vs passive (Van Coetsen)
